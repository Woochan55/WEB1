<h2>WEP이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<img src="cod3.png" width="450">
<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is considered as a form of security protocol that was designed in order to provide a level of security and privacy to a wireless local area network (WLAN) comparable to what is normally expected of a wired local area network.[1] Since a wireless network can transmit data all over an area through radio waves, this data can easily be intercepted through wireless data transmissions. Other users may even be able to eavesdrop on private and confidential conversations made through wireless networks without this form of security. Thus, WEP adds security to a wireless network by encrypting this data. Once data is intercepted, it will become unrecognizable to the system because it has already been encrypted. However, systems that are authorized on the network will be able to recognize and decrypt the data. This is because devices on the network make use of the same encryption algorithm. Thus, the main goal of WEP is to provide security to wireless networks.</p>
